    If you are reading this, then you are probably here because one of the
    trainers has given you this URI. If not, then most of this information
    may not be of interest to you. Should you be interested in this
    workshop, please contact our
    <a href="mailto:agilejs@codecentric.de">training team</a> (workshop is
    available in German and English).
  </p>

    <h2>Installation of necessary software</h2>
    <p>
      Make sure that every team member has a PC/Mac that can be used for
      development. Unix based operating systems work best in our experience, but
      Windows can also be used. If you are willing to, then you can install the
      necessary software on your own machine. Being able to run the software
      outside of any virtual machine is superb and will result in the best
      experience for you during the workshop. For those who are unable to install
      the software or are not willing to, we provide an Ubuntu-based virtual
      machine that can be run using
      <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Native installation</h3>
    <p>
      Providing installation instructions for all the tools is out of scope for
      this document. Most of the necessary tools feature an excellent
      documentation that you can refer to should you run into any issues. In case
      of any outstanding issues, please contact us by mail through
      <a href="mailto:agilejs@codecentric.de?subject=Setup problems">
        agilejs@codecentric.de</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      If you choose the native installation process, please make sure that your
      environment is ready-to-go <strong>before</strong> the workshop!
      Also note that we <strong>cannot support</strong> native installation
      of these tools on Windows machines. Please use the VirtualBox machine if you
      happen to use a Windows machine (see below).
    </div>

    <p>Please make sure that the following tools are installed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">
          Java version 6 or later
        </a>
         (preferably Oracle JDK or Open JDK 7)</li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> (the version control system)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.JS version 10 and NPM</a>
        (node package manager). On OS X and Linux you
        <strong>should</strong> use
        <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">NVM</a>
        (Node Version Manager) which allows you to install global modules without
        super user privileges. To install NVM you need to have git and cURL
        installed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once NPM is installed, you will need to globally install the Grunt
        command line interface. You can do so by running
        <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code>. Depending on your setup, you might
        need to prepend <code>sudo</code> to get the necessary privileges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> as this is the database that
        we are using. Installation normally only requires an extraction of the
        downloaded archive.
      </li>
      <li>
          The latest neo4j has basic authorization enabled by default. This will
          cause the movie-database to throw errors on startup. To <strong>disable
          authorization</strong>, change the <em>dbms.security.auth_enabled</em> in
          <em>NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j-server.properties</em> to <em>false</em>. See also
          <a href="http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/security-server.html#security-server-auth">
            Neo4J Documentation - Securing access</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some code editor that supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We
        recommend either
        <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>,
        <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom Editor</a> or
        <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        At last, you will need a relatively new web browser. Chromium derivatives
        like Google Chrome, Chrome Canary or Chromium itself would be our choice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using the Virtual Machine</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure that you have
      <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> installed.
      With VirtualBox Version 4.2.18 you should not run
      into any issues. Once installed you can start VirtualBox and import the
      virtual machine using <em>File -> Import Appliance</em>. Follow the wizard
      till the end and start the virtual machine. You should now be good to go!
    </p>
    <p>
      The virtual machine is
      <a href="https://public.centerdevice.de/b7b839ee-0db9-4d99-ab9d-ad4a9229781c">
        available through CenterDevice
      </a>
      (hit the download button in the upper-right corner). The box was built
      upon a Ubuntu 15.04 64bit image from
      <a href="http://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu/">osboxes.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neo4j installation folder is <em>~/neo4j-community-2.2.2/</em>. The
      source code for the workshop is available under
      <em>~/movie-database-node</em>. This is only for a first test though.
      During the workshop you will have to clone your own team repository.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <h4>Credentials</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Username: </strong>osboxes<br/>
        <strong>Password: </strong>osboxes.org<br/>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      The <strong>guest additions</strong> are already installed in the image. This
      has been tested with VirtualBox 4.3.28. If guest additions do not work,
      try to reinstall them or use a newer version of VirtualBox!
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      If UI of the virtual machine is very slow, try enabling <strong>3D
        Acceleration</strong> in VirtualBox (Settings -> Display -> 3D Acceleration).
    </div>

    <h3>Check installation</h3>
    <p>
      To check if your installation is correct and you are ready to join the
      workshop, just follow the steps described on our
      <a href="quickstart.html">Quickstart Guide</a>. If you can complete these
      steps, everything is fine.
