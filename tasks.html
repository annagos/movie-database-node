    Tracks and Tasks
  </h1>

  <p>
    This document lists the tasks that participants are supposed to work on
    during the workshop. You can work on the tasks in the given order, from top
    to bottom, if you want to. The tasks are ordered in such a way that
    you are slowly introduced to the used technologies, that is, starting with
    simple frontend improvements and slowly progressing towards server and
    database tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if you are interested in a particular topic (like Node.js, Neo4j or
    CI tooling instead of front end topics), feel free to work on the tasks out
    of order or skip some of the earlier tasks. You will probably not be able to
    finish all tasks during the workshop so make sure to pick the tasks that
    match your interests.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, make sure you take the time to test your code. The workshop situation
    might create an atmoshpere of competition (who can finish more tasks in the
    given time). However, this workshop is about agile best practices and just
    hacking away as fast as possible without writing new tests is not the goal.
    So, take your time and write tests, even if that means that you complete
    less tasks. That is totally fine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each task can be expanded by clicking on the task description or the
    small arrows. Once expanded, one can see additional information such as
    the acceptance criteria and hints. One may also track one's work through
    the status section. A task's status is indicated through the icon next
    to the arrow.
